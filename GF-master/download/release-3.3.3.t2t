==New features==

- New option ``gf -tags`` generates tags files for use with the
  [GF Eclipse plugin http://www.grammaticalframework.org/eclipse/].
- New languages in the Resource Grammar Library: Latvian, Thai, Hindi, Sindhi
 (see the [updated synopsis ../lib/doc/synopsis.html]). Improvements for other
 languages, e.g. Russian and Swedish.
- Improved separate compilation makes recompiling large grammars faster.
  The flag ``-no-pmcfg`` reverts to the old behaviour.
- Version numbers in ``.gfo`` files to avoid problems caused by reuse of
  ``.gfo`` files produced with an incompatible version of the compiler.
- The web-based grammar editor now supports grammar extension and text mode
  editing with instant syntax checking.
- Fix for a bug that prevented the shell commands ``abstract_info``,
  ``generate_random`` and ``generate_trees`` from working properly.
- Various other small improvements and bug fixes.
