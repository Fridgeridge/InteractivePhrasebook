This is a binding to the new GF runtime in C.

The files are:

PGF2.hsc         -- a user API similar to Python and Java APIs
PGF2/FFI.hs      -- an internal module with FFI definitions for 
                 -- the relevant C functions

HOW TO COMPILE:

cabal install

HOW TO USE:

- Import PGF to the Haskell program that you're writing. 
  The Cabal infrastructure will make sure to tell the compiler
  where to find the relevant modules. Example:

  module Main where

  import PGF2
  import qualified Data.Map as Map

  main = do
    pgf <- readPGF "Foo.pgf"
    let Just english = Map.lookup "FooEng" (languages pgf)
