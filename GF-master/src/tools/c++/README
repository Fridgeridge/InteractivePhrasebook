Interpreter for ready-made translation lists. Supports
translation, random generation, and translation quiz.

To compile:

  g++ -o gfex gfex.cpp

To use:

  ./gfex peace.gft

To produce a gft file in GF: 

  gt | tb -unlexer=unwords -compact | wf foo.gft

The format uses encoding of words as integers, which
gives a memory-efficient run-time program. Also the
treebank file size is about 1/3 of sentences stored
in words.
