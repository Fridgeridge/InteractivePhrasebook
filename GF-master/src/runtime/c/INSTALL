General Note
------------

If you want to use the statistical ranking in the parser then you
have to compile your grammar with the option '-probs=grammar.probs',
where grammar.probs must contain a tab separated file with
the probabilities for all functions in the abstract syntax.
In order to enable the named entity recongizer for the ParseEngAbs
grammar you also have to add the option '-literal=Symb' while compiling.


For Linux users
---------------

You will need the packages: autoconf, libtool, make

The compilation steps are:

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install


For Mac OSX users
-----------------

The following is what I did to make it work on MacOSX 10.8:

- Install XCode and XCode command line tools
- Install Homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

$ brew install automake autoconf libtool
$ glibtoolize
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install


For Windows users
-----------------

- Install MinGW: http://www.mingw.org/. From the installer you need
  to select at least the following packages:
     - Mingw-developer-toolkit
     - Mingw-base
     - Msys-base
  After the installation, don't forget to fix the fstab file. See here:
     http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started

- From the MSYS shell (c:/MinGW/msys/1.0/msys.bat) go to the directory 
  which contains the INSTALL file and do:

  $ autoreconf -i
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

  The compiled binaries should be now in c:/MinGW/msys/1.0/local/bin.
