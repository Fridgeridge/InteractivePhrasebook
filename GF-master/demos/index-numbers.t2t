Portable Numeral Translator
15 August 2008

Here is the first GF application for the iPhone. It translates
numerals from digits into number words in 15 languages. It works for
numerals in the range 1-999,999. You can use the demo online in your iPhone's
browser, or download and install it by using FileMagnet (from AppStore).

The demo should work in any web browser supporting JavaScript, but it has been
specially dimensioned for the iPhone screen. It is an application of a general
technology, namely the compilation of GF grammars to JavaScript. Thus you can 
easily build similar applications from your own grammars.

The 
[full numeral translator http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~bringert/gf/translate/], which
works in 88 language and permits arbitrary cross translations, cannot yet be ported
to the iPhone because of memory problems.

The current version has some encoding/font issues in Hebrew and Hindi.

[Download the translator numbers.tgz]. To install: unpack the file and move
the directory ``numbers`` to your FileMagnet uploader.
