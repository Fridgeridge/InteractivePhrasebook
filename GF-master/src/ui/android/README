This directory contains a sample Android app tht uses
the Android speech recognition and TTS APIs along with
JNI bindings to the C PGF runtime to implement a simple
speech translation app.

   installed in $ANDROID_SDK_LOCATION

2. Android NDK: http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/
   installed in	$ANDROID_NDK_LOCATION

= Building =

Set up Android project:

# Creates local.properties, not to be checked in
$ $ANDROID_SDK_LOCATION/tools/android update project -p .

Build libs/libjpgf.jar:

$ (cd ../../runtime/java && javac org/grammaticalframework/*/*.java && jar -cf ../../ui/android/libs/jpgf.jar org/grammaticalframework/*/*.class)

Build JNI code:

$ cd jni
$ $ANDROID_NDK_LOCATION/ndk-build

Build the semantic database code:

$ runghc glosses.hs

Build APK:

$ ant debug


Install on your device:

$ ant debug install
