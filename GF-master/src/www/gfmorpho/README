A service for using smart paradigms on the web.

Works with a cgi script running a Haskell program that calls GF to interprete a query string as a "cc" command on a specified Paradigms file. For instance, if the
user submits the query

  Eng N baby

the program executes the command

  cc -table -unqual ParadigmsEng.mkN "baby"

The resulting output is converted into an HTML table.

The file gfmorpho.html gives some more information. Open issues in addition to those mentioned there are:

- GFMorpho.hs creates the temporary files _gfcommand.tmp and _gfmorpho.tmp which need to be world-writable; they should be created more properly and removed after use
- gfmorpho.cgi defines the variable GF_LIB_PATH to reside in /home/aarne, and must be edited for other environments
- to work for all languages mentioned, one has to compile some incomplete GF grammars not standardly compiled:

  GF/lib/src$ runghc Make alltenses lang langs=Amh,Ara,Lat,Mlt,Tur
