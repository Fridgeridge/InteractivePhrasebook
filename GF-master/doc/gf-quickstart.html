<h1>Grammatical Framework Quick Start</h1>

</center>

This Quick Start shows a few examples of how GF can be used.
We assume that you have downloaded and installed GF, so that
the command <tt>gf</tt> works for you. See download and install
instructions <a href="../download/index.html">here</a>.

<h2>Want to try without downloading?</h2>

<a href="../demos/phrasebook/">Using GF translation</a> with an existing grammar.

<p>

<a href="../demos/gfse/">Writing GF grammars</a> in the cloud, without installing GF.




<h2>Using GF for translation and generation</h2>

When you have downloaded and installed GF:
<ol>
<li> Copy the files
<a href="../examples/tutorial/food/Food.gf"><tt>Food.gf</tt></a>,
<a href="../examples/tutorial/food/FoodEng.gf"><tt>FoodEng.gf</tt></a>, and
<a href="../examples/tutorial/food/FoodIta.gf"><tt>FoodIta.gf</tt></a>.
Or go to <tt>GF/examples/tutorial/food/</tt>, if you have downloaded the
GF sources.

 <li> Start GF with the shell command (without the prompt <tt>$</tt>)
<pre>
  $ gf FoodIta.gf FoodEng.gf
</pre>
Alternatively, start GF with <tt>gf</tt> and give the GF command <tt>import FoodIta.gf FoodEng.gf</tt>.

<li> <b>Translation</b>. Try your first translation by giving the GF command
<pre>
  parse "this cheese is very very Italian" | linearize
</pre>
Notice that the parser accept the tabulator for word completion.

<li> <b>Generation</b>. Random-generate sentences in two languages:
<pre>
  generate_random | linearize
</pre>

<li> <b>Other commands</b>. Use the help command
<pre>
  help
</pre>
<li> <b>More examples</b>. Go to <tt>GF/examples/phrasebook</tt> or some other
subdirectory of  <tt>GF/examples/</tt>. Or try a resource grammar by, for instance,
<pre>
  import alltenses/LangEng.gfo alltenses/LangGer.gfo

  parse -lang=Eng "I love you" | linearize -treebank
</pre>
The resource grammars are found relative to the value of <tt>GF_LIB_PATH</tt>, which
you may have to set; see <a href="../download/index.html">here</a> for instructions.



</ol>



<h2>Grammar development</h2>

Add words to the <tt>Food</tt>
grammars and try the above commands again. For instance, add the following lines:
<pre>
  Bread : Kind ;          -- in Food.gf
  Bread = {s = "bread"} ; -- in FoodEng.gf
  Bread = {s = "pane"} ;  -- in FoodIta.gf
</pre>
and start GF again with the same command. Now you can even translate
<i>this bread is very Italian</i>.
</ol>
To lear more on GF commands and
grammar development, go to the one of the tutorials:
<ul>
<li> <a href="tutorial/gf-tutorial.html">GF Tutorial</a>: older, more programmer-oriented
<li> <a href="gf-lrec-2010.pdf">GF Resource Tutorial</a>: newer, more linguist-oriented
</ul>
To learn about how GF is used for easily writing grammars for 16 languages, consult the
<ul>
<li> <a href="../lib/doc/synopsis.html">GF Resource Grammar Library</a>.
</ul>



<h2>Run-time grammars and web applications</h2>

GF has its own "machine language", PGF (Portable Grammar Format),
which is recommended for use in applications at run time. To produce a PGF file from
the two grammars above, do
<pre>
  gf -make FoodIta.gf FoodEng.gf
  wrote Food.pgf
</pre>
You can use this in Haskell and Java programs, and also on web services, such as
<ul>
<li> the
  <a href="http://cloud.grammaticalframework.org/minibar/minibar.html">minibar</a>
  fridge magnets
</ul>

The quickest way to provide a GF web service is to start GF with the <tt>-server</tt> option:
<pre>
  $ gf -server
  This is GF version 3.3
  Built on linux/i386 with ghc-7.0, flags: interrupt server cclazy
  Document root = /usr/local/share/gf-3.3/www
  Starting HTTP server, open http://localhost:41296/ in your web browser.
</pre>
You can view it locally by pointing your
browser to the URL shown. You can add your own <tt>.pgf</tt> grammar to the service by
copying it over to the <tt>documentRoot</tt> directory. Just push "reload" in
your browser after each such update.

<p>

To build more customized web application, consult the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/grammatical-framework/wiki/SideBar?tm=6">developer wiki</a>.
